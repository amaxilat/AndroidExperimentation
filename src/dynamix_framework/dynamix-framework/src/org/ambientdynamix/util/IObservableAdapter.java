 * Used in the SeparatedListAdapter written by Jeff Sharkey (Copyright 2008 Jeff Sharkey and released under the Apache

 * resources manager. Most of the adapters register an observer in their constructor, but there is was no appropriate
 * place to release them. Parent activities can call this method in their onPause(isFinishing()) block to properly
 * release the observers. If the observers are not released, it will cause a memory leak.
