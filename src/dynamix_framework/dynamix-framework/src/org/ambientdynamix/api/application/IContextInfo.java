/**
 * IContextInfo represents a single entity of contextual information. Concrete IContextInfo implementations provide
 * native, 'high resolution' contextual information appropriate to the given modeling domain. The IContextInfo interface
 * may also include string versions of their data type (e.g. a fully qualified class name), which can be used by capable
 * clients to cast generic IContextInfo as concrete object types. The string-based representation of the IContextInfo
 * should be encoded using a well-known string-based format, and described in the plug-in's developer documentation.
 * Clients use the getStringRepresentationFormat method to locate a suitable parser for string-based representations.
 * <p>
 * The string data is used by clients who may not have access to the given IContextInfo implementation, but are still
 * interested in working with string representations of the data. For example, a ContextEvent containing a
 * java.util.Date may provide an ISO 8601 date format string that clients can parse without needing to have
 * java.util.Date on their class-path. In this case, the string-based format type for the encoded ISO 8601 could be
 * specified using a suitable Dublin Core Date element (e.g. 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date').
 * <p>
 * Note: This interface extends Parcelable, which forces implementers to provide the necessary methods for serializing
 * data according to the AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language). Details at
 * http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/aidl.html.
