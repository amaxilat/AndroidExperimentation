 * The PowerScheme class provides a generic mechanism for specifying the power usage profile of a given
 * ContextPluginRuntime. Broadly, a PowerScheme specifies how a ContextPluginRuntime should attempt to optimize
 * its power consumption in relation to its acquisition performance and modeling precision. Concrete
 * ContextPluginRuntime implementations are free to realize such optimizations as needed for a given context modeling
 * domain; however, the guidelines specified by each static PowerScheme type should be followed as closely as
 * possible.
 * <p>
 * Note that PowerSchemes may be changed during runtime and ContextPluginRuntimes must be capable of dynamically
 * adjusting their power consumption to match new PowerScheme values.
