/**
 * The ContextPluginRuntimeFactory provides instantiation services for concrete ContextPluginRuntime implementations
 * loaded as OSGi bundles. This class should be extended by concrete implementations that inject their associated
 * ContextPluginRuntime implementation Class into the ContextPluginRuntimeFactory's constructor. The injected Class must
 * be an extension of ContextPluginRuntime. During a ContextPlugin's lifecycle, the injected ContextPluginRuntime is
 * dynamically generated using the ContextPluginRuntimeFactory's makeContextPluginRuntime. The
 * ContextPluginRuntimeFactory also supports the (optional) creation of both a acquisitionViewFactory and
 * settingsViewFactory, which are used by ContextPlugins that provide user interfaces.
