The Android Experimentation project
***********************************

Android Experimentation is related to the SmartSantander research project, aiming to provide an Android smartphone
application augmenting the functionality of an existing Future Internet infrastructure. 

The Android software component distributes executable code on smartphone devices of a network of volunteers. The code
is deployed as Ambient Dynamix plugins, performs calculations and produces sensor results, that are uploaded to a central
server. There is a central software component responsible for distributing the plugins and collecting the results.
